                <h4>HACKING AND EXPLOITING</h4>
                <p>Hacking or exploiting game mechanics to gain an unfair advantage over other players is not tolerated.</p>
                <p>> Hacking - examples are not limited to but can include using third-party programs such as in-game automated bots, ESP, Aimbots, and Game Engine Modifications.
                <br/> <br/> > Exploiting - examples are not limited to but can include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Attacking from, travelling through, or building in unintended game-zones (under the mesh or above the map)</li>
                  <li>Duplication of tames, items, or characters</li>
                  <li>Building a box on a platform saddled dino to completely prevent it from taking damage</li>
                  <li>Intentionally crashing users or servers (through DDoS or otherwise)</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Benefit Hacking/Exploiting, Tribes, Alliances, and teaming up.</h5>
                <p>When playing on our servers, players must ensure that they are not taking advantage of hacking exploits and unfair play. Do not under any circumstances allow hackers to join your tribe, alliance, or party up alongside you within the game. It is your responsibility to remove them or yourself from the tribe. If you witness someone breaking the rules through the use of a game exploit, or a third party program (such as ESP or AIMBOT) ensure that you isolate yourself from those users and are not playing with or alongside them to avoid breaching our code of conduct.</p>

                  <h4>GRIEFING</h4>
                  <h5>Spawn Blocking</h5>
                  <p>Spawn Blocking occurs when tribes intentionally block spawn points for the purpose of not allowing any new players to play on the server (including cross server players). In the event your base inadvertently or accidentally resides on a spawn point you will not be penalized.<br/><br/>Here are some examples of what spawn blocking can consist of, but is not limited to:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Using structures that players spawn into and can not get out of (terrian stasis sink holes)</li>
                    <li>Using spikes/spike walls/vaults dino gates at player spawn locations</li>
                    <li>Aggressive dinos placed near spawn points in order to instantly kill players that spawn in.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h5>Small Tribe Server Specific Rules</h5>
                  <p>> No Teaming - to maintain the intent and spirit of the small tribe servers, players are not permitted to form informal alliances between tribes (including cross-server). This includes such things as:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Joint raids against two or more tribes (12 v 6 etc)</li>
                    <li>Building bases together to provide mutual defenses</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h5>PvE Specific Griefing</h5>
                  <p>> Game Blocking - you are not allowed to block other tribes from playing the game/ obtaining resources on our servers. This can include but is not limited to:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Building at their base</li>
                    <li>Blocking access in/out of a tribes base</li>
                    <li>Obstructing pathways or waterways for the purpose of denying another tribe access</li>
                    <li>Blocking access to important resources (ie. charge nodes, gas nodes, Extinction City Terminals, etc)</li>
                    <li>Intentionally filling the server tame limit via spamming tames (such as Dodo, Jerboa, or easy to ‘tame and maintain’ dinos) and/or rafts</li>
                    <li>Leaving tames inside of caves or on obelisk teleportation platforms</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>> Structure Spamming - placing structures down such as pipes or wires for the purpose of disrupting others gameplay is against our code of conduct.<br/><br/>
                    > Intentionally using wild creatures to destroy a player's assets when not in a tribe war.<br/><br/>
                    GM intervention may be necessary if your structure or creature is negatively impacting a server (ie. you block off a large portion of the map so that other members of that server cannot access it).</p>

If KR Gaming determines your name to be improper, we may change the name and or terminate your use of our Public and Patreon Servers. You should not use an alternative spelling to circumvent the name restrictions listed below. You should ensure that your name does not:</p>

                          <li>Impersonate - pretending to be someone else with intent to impersonate Game Masters ("GM") or KR Admins.</li>

                          <p>Interactions with other players or KR GMS/Admins through text chat, voice chat, and signs or paintings must adhere to the rules below and you cannot use an alternative spelling to circumvent restrictions.</p>
                          <h6>Ensure that you do not:</h6>

                            <li>Offend - this includes but is not limited to language which is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, hateful, sexually explicit, or racially, ethnically or otherwise offensive.</li>
                            <li>Post Personal Information/Doxxing - belonging to someone else in the game, or any websites/discord or forums related to the game.</li>
                            <li>Harass, Stalk, Threaten - such as sending repeated unsolicited or unwelcome messages to specific users/tribes and can include but not limited to those sexual in nature or messages that would cause discomfort.</li>
                            <li>Disrupt the game - such as intentionally causing the chat screen to scroll faster than other users are able to read, or setting up macros with large amounts of text that, when used, have a disruptive effect on the normal flow of Chat.</li>
                            <li>Promote - do not send messages which are advertisements for inappropriate topics, including scamming, hacking, exploits or the sale of goods and services unless trading within the game for game specific resources, for example, 50 Stone for 1 Polymer, A trike for a Rex, etc.</li>
                            <li>Real-Money Trading (RMT) - ARK items, creatures, or services must only be exchanged for other items, creatures, or services within the game. Trading for real-world currency (real money) is not an accepted form of trading.</li>
